        <h3>How I Fail Managing Engineer Team

    <p><em>It is always a dilemma whether staying as an active coder or being manager. I still love to code, but I somehow always get trusted to be the one who manage.</em></p>
<p><img src="/images/0002-team.jpg" alt="team"></p>
<p>Last year at my previous work (a matured 100+ years company), I obliged to lead a project as the previous two (yes, it was two persons before) one got promoted, one got transfered to other city. Conditions on the project: first time working together with vendor (3rd party) build the app, also first try to implement scrum, total around 20+ people working on the project. With no one have ever experience on a scrum model, this project become quite catastrophe. Almost never achieve the target set on each two weeks, a daily standup that&rsquo;s not sophisticated, I don&rsquo;t know how to detailing the task, and so on.</p>
<p>Moving to a startup, it is the first time I experience how a scrum run. Sprint grooming, sprint planning, set the story point, do the daily standup, and retrospective at last day of sprint. I learn what went wrong on my previous project and if I can go back in time I know what&rsquo;s need to be done.</p>
<p>In the couple months, I trusted to lead the payment squad with total only 4 people. 2 is on probation and my challenge to them is completed well. But I fail to catch a problem that happen to the one left. She resigned with feeling that her existence is not important, and seems like as a woman her voice is being ignored. Whether it is true or not, I fail to catch the problem even it is not related directly to the work.</p>
<p>Manage the core squad 3 months later is quite easy as the team is mature enough. Everyone know what they&rsquo;re doing and each one has high self awareness. Most of the time I still can do coding.</p>
<p>Big challenge come when I need to lead the backend from 3 different squad at the same time, while also still manage the core team. This is also the first time joining a full product team (before it&rsquo;s just the building the API or work with infra). So I need to know the whole why a feature must build, what&rsquo;s the requirement, how it works on the web and mobile app, working closely with frontend and mobile team.</p>
<p>Having a good experience before with a team that have high self awareness, I&rsquo;m being less worry and just relax. I almost try to left it to the team without doing much with hope everything can be done as expected. Sadly, is not. Even I have some senior engineer level on the team, the team still need to be monitored and managed well. I do even lose the timelines of the target with the squads as it is too much to handle while I still trying to code.</p>
<p>With multiple experience I have managing the team, these are the lessons learned</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s hard handling a big team, like consist of more than 15 or 20 people. When you have it, you need to separate it to different group and choose a lead to each group.</li>
<li>You need to learn how you will run the team, what framework will you use. And make sure your team also know about it.</li>
<li>As manager, you will also being a mentor to the team. Do not ever skip the one on one session at least once a month or two.</li>
<li>Each team is different. Well, you can still learn the experience from any team, however sometimes you can&rsquo;t did the same way for those.</li>
</ul>
